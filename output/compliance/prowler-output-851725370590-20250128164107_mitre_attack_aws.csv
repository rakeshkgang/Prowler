Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives.[1][2][3][4][5][6] Common operating system file deletion commands such as del and rm often only remove pointers to files without wiping the contents of the files themselves, making the files recoverable by proper forensic methodology. This behavior is distinct from Disk Content Wipe and Disk Structure Wipe because individual files are destroyed rather than sections of a storage disk or the disk's logical structure.;Impact;;IaaS | Linux | Windows | macOS;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1485/;AWS CloudEndure Disaster Recovery, AWS Config, AWS RDS, AWS RDS, AWS RDS, AWS S3, AWS Security Hub, Amazon GuardDuty;Respond, Protect, Detect, Protect, Respond, Protect, Detect, Detect;Significant, Partial, Partial, Significant, Significant, Significant, Minimal, Partial;"AWS CloudEndure Disaster Recovery enables the replication and recovery of servers into AWS Cloud. In the event that data on servers is destroyed, AWS CloudEndure can be used to provision an instance of the server from a previous point in time within minutes. As a result, this mapping is given a score of Significant., The following AWS Config managed rules can identify configuration problems that should be fixed in order to prevent malicious write access to data within Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) storage, which may include data destruction: 's3-bucket-blacklisted-actions-prohibited' checks whether bucket policies prohibit disallowed actions (including S3:DeleteObject) for principals from other AWS accounts, 's3-bucket-default-lock-enabled' checks whether a bucket that should be locked in write-once-read-many (WORM) mode is configured to prevent modification, and 's3-bucket-public-write-prohibited' checks whether a bucket is configured to allow public access and modification. All of these controls are run on configuration changes. The following AWS Config managed rules can identify configuration problems that should be fixed in order to ensure backups and redundancy are in place which can mitigate the effects of data destruction: 'aurora-mysql-backtracking-enabled' for data in Aurora MySQL; 'db-instance-backup-enabled' and 'rds-in-backup-plan' for Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) data; 'dynamodb-in-backup-plan' and 'dynamodb-pitr-enabled' for Amazon DynamoDB table contents; 'ebs-in-backup-plan' for Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes; 'efs-in-backup-plan' for Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) file systems; 'elasticache-redis-cluster-automatic-backup-check' for Amazon ElastiCache Redis cluster data; 'redshift-backup-enabled' and 'redshift-cluster-maintenancesettings-check' for Redshift; 's3-bucket-replication-enabled' and 's3-bucket-versioning-enabled' for S3 storage; and 'cloudfront-origin-failover-enabled' for CloudFront. The following AWS Config managed rules provide specific detections for configuration problems that should be fixed in order to prevent malicious deletion of specific data: 'elb-deletion-protection-enabled' for Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes, and 'rds-cluster-deletion-protection-enabled' and 'rds-instance-deletion-protection-enabled' for RDS data. Coverage factor is partial for these rules, since they are specific to a subset of the available AWS services and will only protect certain types of data against destruction, resulting in an overall score of Partial., AWS RDS generates events for database instances and includes the following events that may indicate that an adversary has destroyed the database instance. RDS-EVENT-0003: The DB instance has been deleted RDS-EVENT-0041: A DB snapshot has been deleted. This mapping is given a score of Partial because it can't differentiate between an authorized and unauthorized deletion., AWS RDS provides deletion protection which prevents any user from deleting a database instance. If applied, the setting may mitigate attempts to delete a database instance. As a result, this mapping is given a score of Significant., AWS RDS supports the replication and recovery of database instances. In the event that a database instance is deleted, AWS RDS can be used to restore the database instance to a previous point in time. As a result, this mapping is given a score of Significant., AWS S3 may protect against data destruction through application of several best practices. Multi-factor authentication can be enabled for delete operations and for changing the versioning state of a bucket. Versioning can be enabled to revert objects to a previous state after malicious destruction or corruption. S3 Object Lock can help prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. In addition, S3 Cross Region Replication can be used to replicate S3 buckets to another AWS region for add protection., AWS Security Hub performs a check from the AWS Foundations CIS Benchmark that, if implemented, would help towards detecting the scheduled destruction of Customer Master Keys (CMKs) which are critical for being able to decrypt data. AWS Security Hub provides this detection with the following check. Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for disabling or scheduled deletion of customer created CMKs. This is scored as Minimal because CMKs only represent one type of data that could be destroyed by an adversary., The following GuardDuty finding type flags events where adversaries may destroy data and files on specific systems or in large numbers on a network to interrupt availability to systems, services, and network resources.

This functionality can be used to block adversaries from accessing resources such as cloud storage objects by implementing restrictions on which IP addresses and domains can access the resources (e.g., allow lists). However, since cloud storage objects are located outside the virtual private cloud where the AWS Network Firewall protects, the mapping is only given a score of Partial., AWS RDS supports the encryption of the underlying storage for database instances, backups, read replicas, and snapshots using the AES-256 encryption algorithm. This can protect against an adversary from gaining access to a database instance in the event they get access to the underlying system where the database instance is hosted or to S3 where the backups are stored. Furthermore, with AWS RDS, there is a setting that specifies whether or not a database instances is publicly accessible. When public accessibility is turned off, the database instance will not be available outside the VPC in which it was created. As a result, this mapping is given a score of Significant., S3 provides full control of access via Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and with its access control lists (ACLs). The S3 Block Public Access feature allows for policies limiting public access to Amazon S3 resources that are enforced regardless of how the resources are created or associated IAM policies. Server-side encryption can be enabled for data at rest and allows for use of S3-managed keys, AWS Key Management Service managed keys, or customer-provided keys., AWS Security Hub detects improperly secured data from S3 buckets such as public read and write access that may result in an adversary getting access to data in cloud storage. AWS Security Hub provides this detection with the following managed insight. S3 buckets with public write or read permissions. AWS Security Hub also performs checks from the AWS Foundations CIS Benchmark that, if implemented, would help towards detecting improperly secured S3 buckets which could result in them being discovered. AWS Security Hub provides this detection with the following check. 3.8 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for S3 bucket policy changes.

Multi-factor authentication can be enabled for delete operations and for changing the versioning state of a bucket. Versioning can be enabled to revert objects to a previous state after malicious destruction or corruption. S3 Object Lock can help prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. In addition, S3 Cross Region Replication can be used to replicate S3 buckets to another AWS region for add protection., AWS Security Hub performs a check from the AWS Foundations CIS Benchmark that, if implemented, would help towards detecting the scheduled destruction of Customer Master Keys (CMKs) which are critical for being able to decrypt data.

As a result, this mapping is given a score of Significant., AWS S3 may protect against data destruction through application of several best practices. Multi-factor authentication can be enabled for delete operations and for changing the versioning state of a bucket. Versioning can be enabled to revert objects to a previous state after malicious destruction or corruption. S3 Object Lock can help prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. In addition, S3 Cross Region Replication can be used to replicate S3 buckets to another AWS region for add protection., AWS Security Hub performs a check from the AWS Foundations CIS Benchmark that, if implemented, would help towards detecting the scheduled destruction of Customer Master Keys (CMKs) which are critical for being able to decrypt data.

This functionality can be used to block adversaries from accessing resources such as cloud storage objects by implementing restrictions on which IP addresses and domains can access the resources (e.g., allow lists). However, since cloud storage objects are located outside the virtual private cloud where the AWS Network Firewall protects, the mapping is only given a score of Partial., AWS RDS supports the encryption of the underlying storage for database instances, backups, read replicas, and snapshots using the AES-256 encryption algorithm. This can protect against an adversary from gaining access to a database instance in the event they get access to the underlying system where the database instance is hosted or to S3 where the backups are stored. Furthermore, with AWS RDS, there is a setting that specifies whether or not a database instances is publicly accessible. When public accessibility is turned off, the database instance will not be available outside the VPC in which it was created. As a result, this mapping is given a score of Significant., S3 provides full control of access via Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and with its access control lists (ACLs). The S3 Block Public Access feature allows for policies limiting public access to Amazon S3 resources that are enforced regardless of how the resources are created or associated IAM policies. Server-side encryption can be enabled for data at rest and allows for use of S3-managed keys, AWS Key Management Service managed keys, or customer-provided keys., AWS Security Hub detects improperly secured data from S3 buckets such as public read and write access that may result in an adversary getting access to data in cloud storage. AWS Security Hub provides this detection with the following managed insight. S3 buckets with public write or read permissions. AWS Security Hub also performs checks from the AWS Foundations CIS Benchmark that, if implemented, would help towards detecting improperly secured S3 buckets which could result in them being discovered. AWS Security Hub provides this detection with the following check. 3.8 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for S3 bucket policy changes.

Multi-factor authentication can be enabled for delete operations and for changing the versioning state of a bucket. Versioning can be enabled to revert objects to a previous state after malicious destruction or corruption. S3 Object Lock can help prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. In addition, S3 Cross Region Replication can be used to replicate S3 buckets to another AWS region for add protection., AWS Security Hub performs a check from the AWS Foundations CIS Benchmark that, if implemented, would help towards detecting the scheduled destruction of Customer Master Keys (CMKs) which are critical for being able to decrypt data.

As a result, this mapping is given a score of Significant., AWS S3 may protect against data destruction through application of several best practices. Multi-factor authentication can be enabled for delete operations and for changing the versioning state of a bucket. Versioning can be enabled to revert objects to a previous state after malicious destruction or corruption. S3 Object Lock can help prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. In addition, S3 Cross Region Replication can be used to replicate S3 buckets to another AWS region for add protection., AWS Security Hub performs a check from the AWS Foundations CIS Benchmark that, if implemented, would help towards detecting the scheduled destruction of Customer Master Keys (CMKs) which are critical for being able to decrypt data.

This functionality can be used to block adversaries from accessing resources such as cloud storage objects by implementing restrictions on which IP addresses and domains can access the resources (e.g., allow lists). However, since cloud storage objects are located outside the virtual private cloud where the AWS Network Firewall protects, the mapping is only given a score of Partial., AWS RDS supports the encryption of the underlying storage for database instances, backups, read replicas, and snapshots using the AES-256 encryption algorithm. This can protect against an adversary from gaining access to a database instance in the event they get access to the underlying system where the database instance is hosted or to S3 where the backups are stored. Furthermore, with AWS RDS, there is a setting that specifies whether or not a database instances is publicly accessible. When public accessibility is turned off, the database instance will not be available outside the VPC in which it was created. As a result, this mapping is given a score of Significant., S3 provides full control of access via Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and with its access control lists (ACLs). The S3 Block Public Access feature allows for policies limiting public access to Amazon S3 resources that are enforced regardless of how the resources are created or associated IAM policies.

The following AWS Config managed rules can identify configuration problems that should be fixed in order to ensure that insecure applications are not installed and installed packages are kept updated, reducing the likelihood of adversary exploitation: the 'ec2-managedinstance-applications-blacklisted' managed rule verifies that a pre-defined list of applications are not installed on specified managed instances. It can be used to identify the presence of vulnerable applications (prompting removal before they can be exploited) and/or to identify the presence of allowed packages below a minimum version (prompting updates before they can be exploited). The 'ec2-managedinstance-platform-check' managed rule verifies that managed instances are running desired platform types, including using a desired version (as opposed to an out-of-date one). Both can reduce instances' attack surface for adversary exploitation. 'rds-automatic-minor-version-upgrade-enabled' can verify that Amazon RDS is being patched, and 'elastic-beanstalk-managed-updates-enabled' can verify that Elastic Beanstalk is being patched. Coverage factor is partial for these rules, since they are specific to a subset of the available AWS services that can be used to host public-facing applications and will only protect against certain forms of identifiable exploitation, resulting in an overall score of Partial., AWS RDS supports the automatic patching of minor versions of database instances.

This functionality can be used to block adversaries from accessing resources such as cloud storage objects by implementing restrictions on which IP addresses and domains can access the resources (e.g., allow lists). However, since cloud storage objects are located outside the virtual private cloud where the AWS Network Firewall protects, the mapping is only given a score of Partial., AWS RDS supports the encryption of the underlying storage for database instances, backups, read replicas, and snapshots using the AES-256 encryption algorithm. This can protect against an adversary from gaining access to a database instance in the event they get access to the underlying system where the database instance is hosted or to S3 where the backups are stored. Furthermore, with AWS RDS, there is a setting that specifies whether or not a database instances is publicly accessible. When public accessibility is turned off, the database instance will not be available outside the VPC in which it was created. As a result, this mapping is given a score of Significant., S3 provides full control of access via Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and with its access control lists (ACLs). The S3 Block Public Access feature allows for policies limiting public access to Amazon S3 resources that are enforced regardless of how the resources are created or associated IAM policies.

The following AWS Config managed rules can identify configuration problems that should be fixed in order to ensure that insecure applications are not installed and installed packages are kept updated, reducing the likelihood of adversary exploitation: the 'ec2-managedinstance-applications-blacklisted' managed rule verifies that a pre-defined list of applications are not installed on specified managed instances. It can be used to identify the presence of vulnerable applications (prompting removal before they can be exploited) and/or to identify the presence of allowed packages below a minimum version (prompting updates before they can be exploited). The 'ec2-managedinstance-platform-check' managed rule verifies that managed instances are running desired platform types, including using a desired version (as opposed to an out-of-date one). Both can reduce instances' attack surface for adversary exploitation. 'rds-automatic-minor-version-upgrade-enabled' can verify that Amazon RDS is being patched, and 'elastic-beanstalk-managed-updates-enabled' can verify that Elastic Beanstalk is being patched.
